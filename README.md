# Efficacy of Convolutional Neural Network with Various Dimension Filters

=> Our project is to present an effective classification method for traffic 
signs on the basis of a Convolutional Neural Network with various 
dimension filters.

=> The studied dimensions of convolution layer 
filters are 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, 9x9, 11x11, 13x13, 15x15 and 19x19. The 
dimensions of the filters were varied from 1-15 pixels in accordance 
with which the input image is convolved with certain processing depth 
of image borders and dimensions.

=> The complete dataset is divided into 
training, validation, and testing. The variation of classification 
accuracy and average processing time depends solely on dimension of 
convolutional layer filters. 

=> The highest validation accuracies for filters 
5x5, 7x7 and 9x9 and their respective accuracies 0.962, 0.940 and 
0.939 were recorded and average processing time for filters 7x7, 9x9, 
5x5 are 0.061, 0.066, 0.0712(s) were recorded.

## Main Objectives & Outcomes

1) To predict the traffic hoardings using Convolution Neural 
Network.

2) CNN Filtersâ€™ dimensional efficacy impact on traffic hoarding 
classification.

3) Determination of testing accuracy and average classification 
time of each filter.

4) Implementation on basis of a convolution neural network with 
various dimension filters.
